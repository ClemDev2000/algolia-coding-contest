# Algolia Coding Contest 2021 (Second category)

This project was entirely created for Algolia Coding Contest 2021.

The website is called Localz. It's a P2P marketplace where everyone can sell and buy products posted by others.

Note: _This project is configured to run **french businesses**. As a result, **Stripe connected accounts** will be created with `country: 'FR'` params and **Mapbox Geocoding API** will only show FR addresses. Moreover the main currency is **EUR**. For convenience and for the internationality of this competition, English is used as the main language._

This project was made with:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Algolia API](https://www.algolia.com/doc/) (Geo search + Faceting + Filtering + Personalization + Analytics)
- [Stripe API](https://stripe.com/docs) (Connect + Checkout)
- [Firebase API](https://firebase.google.com/docs/guides) (Firestore + Storage + Auth)
- [Mapbox Geocoding API](https://docs.mapbox.com/api/search/geocoding/)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com) (for the live demo)
